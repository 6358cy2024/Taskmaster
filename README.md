# Taskmaster

The point of this assignment is to see if I can use modals to create a scheduling page
In this assignment I will be able to create a page that has drag and drop features
The users will be able to create a task, a due date, and a basic description of the assignment and place it in categories depending on the urgency of the assignment.

The tasks should be able to remain when the page is refreshed
